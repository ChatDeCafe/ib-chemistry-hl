## **Structure 2.1**
	- ### **Structure 2.1.1**
		- **What is an ionic bond?**#card
	- An ionic bond is caused by the transfer of electrons from a cation to an anion, creating a strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. The formation of ionic compounds, such as Na + Cl ⇒ NaCl can be described a redox reaction.
		- **What are two assumptions of the ionic model?**#card
	- The crystal is made of spherical ions and only interact with electrostatic forces.
		- **Metal ions form ... because they have ...**#card
	- Positive ions (cations), low ionisation energy
		- **Non-metal ions form ... because they have ...**#card
	- Negative ions (anions), high ionisation energy
		- **The most vigorous reactions occur with...**#card
	- Elements far apart on the periodic table, due to high differences in electronegativity
		- **Why is Na 2+, Mg 3+ etc. not feasible?**#card
	- Their successive ionisation energy increases dramatically after Na+, Mg 2+ etc which makes reactions to form these charges energetically unfeasible.
		- **Do Group 14 (metalloids such as Si) form ions?**#card
	- No
		- **Why do transition metals have variable oxidation states?**#card
	- We refer to their charge as oxidation states and not ionic charges as looking at their successive ionisation energies reveals multiple energetically favourable number of electrons that can be removed.
		- **Atoms with a greater than +3 charge show...**#card
	- Covalent character because they have large charge density that can polarise negative ions and create higher covalent character.
	- ### **Structure 2.1.2**
		- **What is an ionic lattice?**#card
	- A three-dimensional structure of oppositely charged ions held together by strong electrostatic forces. These ionic bonds rarely occur in isolation thus form these lattices.
		- **What is coordination number in relation to ionic bonds?**#card
	- The number of ions of opposite charge surrounding a given ion in a crystal lattice.
		- **What is a unit cell?**#card
	- A unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of a crystal lattice.
		- **What is lattice enthalpy?**#card
	- Lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change when one mole of an ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions. It also measures the strength of an ionic bond.
		- **Energy is required/released when particles are separated?**#card
	- Required, thus this is endothermic and can be expressed by $\Delta H > 0$
		- **Energy is required/released when particles come together?**#card
	- Released, thus this is exothermic and can be expressed by $\Delta H < 0$. This offsets the energy needed to make the compound, making it energetically feasible.
		- **Ionic compounds have ... melting and boiling points and ... volatility?**#card
	- High, low as the ionic bond is very strong, these are stronger when ionic charge is higher
		- **Sodium halides melting/boiling point ... down a group**#card
	- Decreases down Group 7 due to increased ionic radii and weaker forces
		- **Ionic compounds are ... in water/polar solvents and ... in non polar solvents.**#card
	- Soluble, insoluble
		- **Ionic compounds when they dissociate in water are called...?**#card
	- Hydrated as they separate from the lattice
		- **Ionic compounds ... electricity in ... state.**#card
	- Conduct in aqueous/liquid as their ions are mobile. In solid state, they are fixed as thus cannot conduct electricity.
		- **Why are ionic compounds brittle?**#card
	- Their lattice structure becomes disrupted with shear force and causes repulsion and breaks apart.
		- **What is the formula for ionic character?**#card
	- $\frac{\Delta \chi}{3.2}$
		- **Ionic compounds have an electronegativity difference...**#card
	- Greater than 1.8

		- **What are London dispersion forces? (LDFs)**#card
	- Intermolecular forces through instantaneous temporary dipoles formed within molecules (shift in electron cloud to make one end more negative and one end more positive). They exist between non-polar molecules and cause them to have low melting and boiling points (e.g., O2)

	- Forces between molecules that do not bond together or experience electrostatic attraction and includes LDFs, dipole-dipole and dipole-induced dipole forces.
		- **What is hydrogen bonding?**#card
	- The strongest form of intermolecular force and is caused by a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom and a lone pair of electrons on another electronegative atom such as N, O, F (but not C). As the electronegative atom attempts to take these electrons, hydrogen exerts a stronger force on them due to these electrons being its only electrons and there are no shielding electrons remaining. This is NOT a van der Waals' force.

		- **What is a pi (**$\pi$**) bond?**#card
	- When two orbitals combine laterally (side-on) and they only form between p orbitals, thus are only found in double or triple bonds. They are weaker than sigma bonds and their electron density is further from the nucleus, creating this weakness.

	- The formation of hybrid orbitals that have an energy in the middle of the orbitals combined.
