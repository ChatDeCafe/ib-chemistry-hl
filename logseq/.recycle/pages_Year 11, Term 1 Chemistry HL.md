		- **State and explain the trend of ionic radius**#card
		  \Ionic radius increases down a group and decreases across a period for the same reasons as atomic radius. Cations have a smaller radius as protons remains the same but electrons decrease, increasing ENC and the opposite for anions.

		  \It increases down the group with metals as they tend to lose electrons when they react and attraction between nucleus and valence electrons decrease down a group. It decreases down the group with non-metals as they tend to gain electrons in reactions, attraction is weaker thus takes more energy to bond and is less recative.
