    - ### Structure 2.1.1 
        - What is an ionic bond?#card
			 -An ionic bond is caused by the transfer of electrons from a cation to an anion, creating a strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. The formation of ionic compounds, such as Na + Cl â‡’ NaCl can be described a redox reaction.
        - What are two assumptions of the ionic model?#card
			 -The crystal is made of spherical ions and only interact with electrostatic forces.  
        - Metal ions form ... because they have ...#card
			 -Positive ions (cations), low ionisation energy
        - Non-metal ions form ... because they have ...#card
			 -Negative ions (anions), high ionisation energy 
        - The most vigorous reactions occur with...#card
			 -Elements far apart on the periodic table, due to high differences in electronegativity
        - Why is Na 2+, Mg 3+ etc. not feasible?#card
			 -Their successive ionisation energy increases dramatically after Na+, Mg 2+ etc which makes reactions to form these charges energetically unfeasible.
        - Do Group 14 (metalloids such as Si) form ions?#card
			 -No 
        - Why do transition metals have variable oxidation states?#card
			 -We refer to their charge as oxidation states and not ionic charges as looking at their successive ionisation energies reveals multiple energetically favourable number of electrons that can be removed.
        - Atoms with a greater than +3 charge show...#card
			 -Covalent character because they have large charge density that can polarise negative ions and create higher covalent character. 
    - ### Structure 2.1.2 
        - What is an ionic lattice?#card
			 -A three-dimensional structure of oppositely charged ions held together by strong electrostatic forces. These ionic bonds rarely occur in isolation thus form these lattices.
        - What is coordination number in relation to ionic bonds?#card
			 -The number of ions of opposite charge surrounding a given ion in a crystal lattice.
        - What is a unit cell?#card
			 -A unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of a crystal lattice.
        - What is lattice enthalpy?#card
			 -Lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change when one mole of an ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions. It also measures the strength of an ionic bond.
        - Energy is required/released when particles are separated?#card
			 -Required, thus this is endothermic and can be expressed by $\Delta H > 0$ 
        - Energy is required/released when particles come together?#card

As the electronegative atom attempts to take these electrons, hydrogen exerts a stronger force on them due to these electrons being its only electrons and there are no shielding electrons remaining. This is NOT a van der Waals' force.
