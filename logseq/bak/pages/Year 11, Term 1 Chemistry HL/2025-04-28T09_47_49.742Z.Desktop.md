- ## **Structure 1.3**
	- ### **Structure 1.3.2 - Emission spectrum**
		- **What is the difference between emission and absorption spectrum?**→Emission spectra show the wavelengths of light emitted by an excited atom, while absorption spectra show the wavelengths of light absorbed by an atom in its ground state.
		- **How does emission spectrum work?**→A photon of energy is added to the atoms which excites electrons and raises them to a higher energy level. When they eventually stablise, they release a photon of energy which can be measured.

		- **At what point do you take the wavelength to calculate ionisation energy?**→Convergence ($\Delta \lambda =0$)
		- **Why does taking electrons from lower shells require greater energy?**→Stronger attraction between nucleus and electrons, thus requiring greater energy.
		- **Why are ionisation energies of group 3 less than group 2 and group 8 less than 7?**→Electrons are lone in those shells and are of higher energy level and thus have less attraction with the nucleus.

	- ### **Structure 1.5.1 - Key assumptions of the ideal gas model**
		- **What are the assumptions of the ideal gas model?**→![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/s0CyaR0fh4iWZQ7MZxFgx7Xm15xH_7odv_85h3WgspbU1xTEm9-cEfuagHij37UU4u98M0T9XzZFRaA7bxRfLN7HbNdF3qzAHydpWF-UbRHJ4806rr496LI32toLbDn9.png)

		- **How do you check if a gas is an ideal one?**→When$\frac{PV}{RT} =1$
		- **Gases behave most like ideal gases with...?**→Low pressure (allows volume of particles to be insignificant) and high temperature (decreases attractive forces between molecules)
		- **If volume of gas particles is not negligible, then**$\frac{PV}{RT}$**is...?**→Greater than one
		- **If there are attractive forces between the molecules, then**$\frac{PV}{RT}$**is...?**→Less than one
		- **Gases deviate from ideal gas behaviour with...?**→High pressure (volume of particles becomes significant) and low temperature (molecules slower so there are more attractive forces between molecules)
		- **Why do real gases deviate from ideal gases?** >>1.
		    1. Real gases experience intermolecular forces (thus real gases would have lower volume than ideal gases at the same pressure)
		    2. Real gases have an observable volume
		- **Why does water vapour deviate more from ideal behaviour than nitrogen gas when cooled?**→There is greater intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, nitrogen is non-polar
- ## **Structure 3.1**
	- ### **Structure 3.1.3 - Periodicity**
		- **What is atomic radius?**→Atomic radius is half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms bonded together.
		- **State and explain the trend of atomic radius.**→Atomic radius increases down a group due to the increasing number of protons and same number of shielding electrons, allowing for greater ENC. It decreases down a period due to the same number of protons and greater shielding electrons, lowering ENC.
		- **State and explain the trend of ionic radius**→Ionic radius increases down a group and decreases across a period for the same reasons as atomic radius. Cations have a smaller radius as protons remains the same but electrons decrease, increasing ENC and the opposite for anions.
		- **What is ionisation energy?**→The energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms.
		- **State and explain the trend of ionisation energy.**→Ionisation energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group due to increasing nuclear charge and increasing atomic radius, respectively.
		- **What is electron affinity?**→Electron affinity is the energy change when an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom.
		- **State and explain the trend of electron affinity.**→Electron affinity generally increases across a period and decreases down a group due to increasing nuclear charge and greater shielding electrons respectively.
		- **What is electronegativity?**→Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond.
		- **State and explain the trend of electronegativity.**→Electronegativity increases across a period and decreases down a group due to increasing ENC and greater shielding electrons respectively.
		- **What is reactivity?**→The tendency of an atom or molecule to undergo a chemical reaction.
		- **State and explain the trend of reactivity.**→It increases down the group with metals as they tend to lose electrons when they react and attraction between nucleus and valence electrons decrease down a group. It decreases down the group with non-metals as they tend to gain electrons in reactions, attraction is weaker thus takes more energy to bond and is less recative.
	- ### **Structure 3.1.4 - Trends with alkali metals and halogens**
		- **Metal + halogen**→metal halide
		- **What is metallic character?**→Metallic character is the tendency of an atom to lose electrons and form positive ions.
		- **What is the trend of metallic character?**→It decreases down a period (greater ENC) and increases down a group (shielding electrons).
		- **Metal + water**→metal hydroxide + hydrogen gas
		- **Metal + oxygen**→Metal oxide
		- **Metal oxide + water**→Base (with OH)
		- **Explain the increased melting and boiling points of halogens down a group.**→They increase in size down the group, leading to greater van der Waal's forces and LDFs, increasing energy required to separate the molecules.
		- **Explained decreased activity of halogens down a group.**→Their radius increases, leading to greater shielding  and the electron gain becomes difficult making it difficult for them to oxide elements.

	- ### Structure 3.1.6
	- ### **Structure 3.1.8 - Transition metals**

		- **Transition metal complex are...**→Coloured
		- **How can we see the colour of transition metal complexes?**→It absorbs the wavelength of light that is opposite to what we see. For example, to be cyan, it absorbs orange but all other colours pass through it yet it looks cyan to us. This is transition (opposite of absorption)
		- **To be coloured, transition metals in complexes need to have...?**→Partially filled d-orbitals.
		- **What does it mean by degenerate orbitals?**→Orbitals of the same energy.
		- **What is crystal field theory and how does it explain why transition metal complexes can have different colours?**→The theory shows that the energy difference between the split orbitals corresponds to the different wavelengths of energy that is absorbed, thus exhibiting different colours.
		- **Why are transition metal complexes coloured?** >>1.
		    1. Ligands cause splitting of degenerate d-orbitals through repulsion and attraction
		    2. Electrons from lower energy d-orbitals absorb a specific wavelength/frequency and are promoted
		    3. The colour observed is complementary to the specific wavelength/frequency absorbed
