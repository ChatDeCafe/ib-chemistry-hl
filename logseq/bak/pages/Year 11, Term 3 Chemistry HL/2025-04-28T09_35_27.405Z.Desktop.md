## **Reactivity 2.2**
	- ### **Reactivity 2.2.6,7,8**
		- **What is a reaction mechanism?**#card
			- A sequence of steps for a reaction to occur.
		- **What are products produced in between the first and final steps of a reaction?**#card
			- Intermediates
		- **What is each step of a reaction called?**→Elementary steps
		- **What is a unimolecular elementary step?**→A step that involves a single reactant particle
		- **What is a bimolecular elementary step?**→A step that involves two reactant particles
		- **What is a trimolecular elementary step?**→A step that involves three reactant particles (but are rare due to the low probability of more than two particles colliding at the same time with sufficient energy and correct orientation)
		- **What is a rate determining step?**→The slowest step in the sequence (reactants can only be produced as fast as the slowest step).
		- **Describe each maxima and minima in the following reaction graph:**![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/SJUCdaJl-IbYCB8MlTu3k_J9SKmksdAPCJvgGyeWntTBKtiElF5qkjUP2_hbg6vIO4Qq56HQMLCoBxfV3wlz1y2cH3GbC7zQfrfV8DXRECMY8m2giaef1yeFyljukA69.png) >>>
			- The two maxima represent transition states
			- The minima in between represents intermediate products
		- **What is a transition state?**→An unstable state where reactants are quickly converted to products

	- ### **Reactivity 2.2.9,10,11**
		- **What is a general expression of a rate?**→$\frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t}$where A is products and t is time.
		- **What is the general expression of the rate of reaction?**→$R=k[A]^m[B]^n$where k is the rate constant, A and B are reactants and $m,n \in \mathbb{Z^+}$and are the orders of reaction
		- **What is the overall reaction order when given **$R=k[A]^m[B]^n$?→$m+n$
		- **A zero-order reaction means that...**→The concentration of A does not influence the reaction, thus gradient of the rate of reaction is k.

		- **A first-order reaction means that...**→The rate of reaction is directly proportional to A.

		- **A second order reaction means that...**→The rate of reaction is directly proportional to the square of the concentration of A.
