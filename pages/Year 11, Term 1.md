		- **State and explain the trend of ionic radius**#card
			- Ionic radius increases down a group and decreases across a period for the same reasons as atomic radius. Cations have a smaller radius as protons remains the same but electrons decrease, increasing ENC and the opposite for anions.

			- The energy required to remove 1 mole of electrons from 1 mole of gaseous atoms.
		- **State and explain the trend of ionisation energy.**#card

		- **What is reactivity?**#card
			- The tendency of an atom or molecule to undergo a chemical reaction.
		- **State and explain the trend of reactivity.**#card
			- It increases down the group with metals as they tend to lose electrons when they react and attraction between nucleus and valence electrons decrease down a group. It decreases down the group with non-metals as they tend to gain electrons in reactions, attraction is weaker thus takes more energy to bond and is less recative.
